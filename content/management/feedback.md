Title: Giving feedback that is easy to listen to

The whole point of feedback is to change someone’s behavior in the future. That only works if you can give it in a form that they can listen to. This is a template I got from the wonderful Manager Tools on how to give feedback in a way that maximizes the chance that your feedback will be heard.

## Use the "When you {verb}ed ... what happened was ..." model

### "When you"

 - Identify the externally visible past behavior, not mindset or intent.
 - You should be so descriptive (or so recent to the event) that they can identify a specific instance of them exhibiting the behavior
 - Deliberately force yourself to give feedback about only specific instances and not patterns – it will force you to give feedback that is easier to listen to.

### "What happened was"

 - Identify impact in the context of the event
 - Great feedback uses impact that resonates with the listener, e.g. "the project delivered late" vs "Tim was sad" are valued differently by different people on the team.

## Examples

 - "_**When you**_ added an emoji to my slack message, _**what happened was**_ I felt I was part of a team"
 - "_**When you**_ interrupted me when I was talking about API design in the team meeting, _**what happened was**_ I stopped offering my perspective during the discussion"
 - "_**When you**_ provided an alternative doc comment in my code review, _**what happened was**_ it was easy for me to incorporate the change"

## Subtle failure modes

 - _"You come off as mean; for example, you interrupted me"_

    - Providing feedback of the form "pattern example" is especially dangerous, since it can create a story that is hard to recover from. (If the person stops interrupting, are they still mean?).
    - Instead, prefer the form "instance consequence", so it is more clear that changing the behavior will change the effect: _"When you interrupted me, you came off as an asshole"_

 - _"When you started speaking while I was speaking, what happened was I felt insulted"_

    - Impact on your emotions is ok, but some words can accidentally ascribe intent (did the person intend to insult you?).
    - Instead, prefer words that describe your emotional state (for examples, check out [this list](https://www.cnvc.org/training/resource/feelings-inventory)): _"When you started speaking while I was speaking, what happened was I felt angry"_

 - _"When you interrupt me, what happens is I stop speaking"_

    - Giving feedback in present tense usually is about a pattern and is generally less credible; its easy for someone to say "I didn't do that" or "I stopped doing that" or "you only notice bad things", etc.
    - Instead, use past tense and prefer feedback about specific examples: _"When you interrupted me in the team meeting, what happened is I stopped speaking"_.

## Get the right context

Manager Tools warns (rightly) that it is very dangerous to give feedback when
you can't be sure the other person knows its coming from a place of love:

 - Wait until you have a strong relationship to give feedback.
 - Avoid doing it when angry.
 - Aim to do it with a laugh and a wry smile on your face.
 - Avoid doing it in writing, where people have to infer emotions.
