Title: Escalate the channel, not the conflict

*Escalate the channel, not the conflict* is a principle of conflict resolution.
When a conversation with someone goes awry, switch to a more personal medium
of communication rather than escalating (e.g. to a boss, etc.).

Talking privately in person is the most personal, then video chat, then voice
chat, then private text chat, then private email, then group email, then public
work tracking tool (e.g. issue tracker or code review).

More personal channels allow people to more effectively convey emotions and 
empathize with each other, ideally avoiding conflicts.
