Summary: Some thoughts on how to give better apologies.

I've been thinking about apologies recently. In both personal and
professional relationships, I've found that the best apologies have the
following 4 parts:

 - "What I did I was wrong"
 - "I messed up when I ..."
 - "I understand how this would cause you to feel ..."
 - "In the future, I'm going to ..."

This format has a few subtle points in it:

 - "I was wrong" is an explicit admission of guilt and forces me to be
   sincere. It makes the apology much more effective.
 - It is important to be specific about _what_ behavior was wrong. This
   specificity allows me to demonstrate that I listened by describing my
   behavior from their perspective. 
 - It is super powerful to reflect the person's emotion back to them. Again,
   this is an opportunity to demonstrate listening; this _also_ shows that I
   think their reaction was valid.
 - Providing a short description of my corrective actions shows
   that I am taking responsibility for my behavior by providing an
   _unconditional_ commitment to change.
 - It is relatively short, which makes it easy to remember and harder to drag
   out a potentially emotional process.

Put all together, an apology might sound like this:

 - "I'm sorry, I was wrong to shout at you in that fight. I understand how
   that made your feel scared. In the future, I'm going to take a few deep
   breaths to calm down."
 - "I'm sorry about that meeting. I was wrong to report your status as red in
   front of your boss without discussing you first; I bet it made you feel
   frustrated. In the future, I'll make sure to sync up with you about the
   status beforehand."

But there are a lot of ways I used to accidentally screw up apologies.
Here are some apology tips:

 - _I explained 'why' I acted that way._
 
     - Saying "the reason why", "What I was thinking", "my intent was", or "because"
       is the fastest way to ruin the apology by making it about me, not them.
       Worse, it can make it seem like I am attempting to absolve myself of
       my mistake. 
       Instead, I find its better to say "It doesn't matter why I did that, I
       know it still made you feel ..."

 - _I mentioned the other's behavior in my apology._ 
   
     - Saying "I was wrong
       to raise my voice when you ..." is too close to offering an excuse (see the
       previous point).

 - _I waited for them to be ready to apologize_. 
 
     - I let a few important
       relationships sour because I was "right" and was waiting for the other
       person to apologize first.
       Instead, I try to apologize as soon as I am ready for _my part_: the actions
       that I genuinely acknowledge were hurtful, ineffective, etc. Here, being
       specific about my behavior during the apology helps me be genuine. For
       example, "I was wrong to raise my voice".

 - _I apologized for their reaction, not my behavior_. 
 
     - "I was wrong to make you
       upset" or "I'm sorry that you got upset" are both missing the description
       of _my actions_ that provoked that reaction. Instead, I try to explicitly
       refer
       to my behavior: "I was wrong to shout" or "I was wrong to use a high
       pitched tone of voice."

 - _I qualifed the apology_. 
 
 
     - Saying "I'm sorry if ..." or "in the future, I
       will ... if ..." similarly indicates only conditional acceptance of responsibility.

 - _I apologized in writing._
 
     - This is a conversation where emotions
       matter; I now do it in the most personal channel I have available (in
       person > video call > phone call).
