Title: Reading intern resumes

Tonight, I sat down and read through every resume in the 2013 SCS senior
resume book. Reading resumes for a company is really interesting, because
I find myself looking at them very differently. As a student, I didn't
really understand what sections of the resume are important. I thought
it would be interesting to give a brief walk through of my resume scan
process[^1].

[^1]: Note this is the process I use for CMU resumes, where I know the courses intimately.

I look at the sections of the resume in roughly this order:

 1.  _Graduation year / major._ I want to know if I'm dealing with a
     Sophomore/Junior/Senior so I know how to evaluate the classes
	 and work experience. I also glance at the major, because there are
	 a few majors that are red flags (no, I will not skip your resume
	 if you are in IS. IS actually *isn't* a red flag to me, and a single
	 red flag is not a veto). 
	 
	 -    _I do not care_ about your GPA, although I will be concerned if it 
	      is below at 3.2.
		  
 2.  _Courses taken._ I want to know what experience you have and what you find
     interesting (or what you think employers will find interesting).
	 
	 -     _I want to see_ the courses you've taken that *aren't* required or
	       were an option for you. In
	       particular, I am interested in seeing the 300 and 400 level courses
		   you've taken (if you're a systems person, for example, I expect to
		   see more than one upper level systems course). While I cannot tell
		   how well you did in the courses if you don't tell me (that 
		   information would actually be super useful), I hope to get
		   an idea of what interests you from your choice in courses. You should
		   also be aware that as a CMU graduate, I'm well of the fact that some
		   courses are more difficult than others. Did you take Compilers and
		   Parallel as a Junior, or are just only now taking Distributed as a
		   senior? If you're a sophomore who
		   hasn't taken any of these courses yet, I'm interested in seeing which
		   core courses you've taken.
		   
 3.  _Projects._ I want to know what you've done when you had the freedom to 
     choose what to do.
 
	 -   _I want to see_ interesting projects you did for fun or as a 
	     class final project where you got to choose what to do. 
	 -   _I don't want to see_ projects required for a course where you
	     had no influence on the design. I took the same courses at CMU as
		 you, I am wholly unimpressed by a "web proxy" project (and am 
		 actually concerned if I see that on a senior resume).
	 -   _I am worried by_ hackathon projects. This is my personal
	     opinion, but I'm generally worried by projects that were intended
		 to have a flashy demo and weren't designed for longevity. I want
		 you to see projects that you're *proud* of and am generally
		 suspicious that a 2 day project has enough interesting ideas or
		 well designed code for this.
	 -   _I usually find it hard to discern anything_ from research projects. If
	     you describe the interesting work the project is doing, it is
		 hard to know what *you* did. Even if you describe what you did, 
		 it is hard to know how much influence you had in the design
		 process for the project.

At this point, I've learned enough to identify the people I definitely want to
talk to and the people I definitely don't want to talk to. To try to sort the
people I'm still not sure about, I will look at two more pieces of information:

 -  _Order of languages on your resume._ If you say you are a systems person but
    you put PHP ahead of C, I'm skeptical.
 -  _Other companies._ If I'm otherwise unsure about your resume, but you've had 
    internships at large / good companies, thats a good sign. If you haven't had
	very many / any internships, thats a bad sign. I don't really read what you
	did - I assume you were like me and were involved on a project you didn't
	have much control over that wasn't related to the core business. 
 -  _Teaching assistant for 200+ level courses._ It is a good sign if you TA for
    a 200 level course or above (and a great sign if you TA for a 400 level
	course). There are a *lot* of 100 level TAs, so it is hard to get anything
	meaningful out of that. Also, which semesters you were a TA can be helpful.
