Title: About

This is the personal blog of Alex Reece.  Some quick facts about me:

-   My [resume](https://github.com/awreece/resume) is on Github (no pdf version
    there for now).
-   `vim` is my editor, `git` is my DVCS, `zsh` is my shell, and I know more `make` than is
    comfortable.

I started this blog because I enjoy summarizing and explaining
the interesting things I've. 

The idea is to update as much as a once or twice a week with a brief post about
something interesting I've done or learned.

The target audience will vary, but generally the posts will be
readable by someone who is familiar with programming and exposed to some
systems topics.

If you want to use anything, please properly attribute it to me and include a link back to the original content. I'd also appreciate an email - I love to hear that I was able to help people! :)
