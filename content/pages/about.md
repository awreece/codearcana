Title: About

This is the personal blog of Alex Reece.  Some quick facts about me:

-   I am a member of the [Plaid Parliament of Pwning (PPP)](http://pwning.net),
    a computer security research group and CTF team from CMU. 
-   I work at [MemSQL](http://www.memsql.com/) in San Francisco.
-   My [resume](https://github.com/awreece/resume) is on Github (no pdf version
    there for now).
-   `vim` is my editor, `git` is my DVCS, `zsh` is my shell, and I know more `make` than is
    comfortable.

I started this blog because I find the process of summarizing and explaining
the interesting things I've done very rewarding. The idea is to update as much as
a once or twice a week with a brief post about something interesting I've done
or learned. The target audience will vary, but generally the posts will be
readable by someone who is familiar with programming and exposed to some
systems topics.
Expect to see semi-regular thoughts on software engineering, computer systems, 
security, and more.
