Title: About

This is the personal blog of Alex Reece.  Some quick facts about me:

-   I am a member of the [Plaid Parliament of Pwning (PPP)](http://pwning.net),
    a computer security research group and CTF team from CMU. 
-   I will be starting work at [Delphix](http://www.delphix.com/) and will
    be living in San Francisco shortly after I graduate.
-   My [resume](https://github.com/awreece/resume) is on Github (no pdf version
    there for now).
-   `vim` is my editor, `git` is my DVCS, and I know more `make` than anybody
    should.

I started this blog because I find the process of summarizing and explaining
the interesting things I've done very rewarding. The idea is to update as much as
a once or twice a week with a brief post about something interesting I've done
or learned.
Expect to see semi-regular thoughts on software engineering, computer systems, 
security, and more.
